## Quality Enforcement

**Every task that produces code MUST end with a Completion Checklist.**

Before finishing ANY implementation task, output this checklist verbatim and fill it in:

```
## Completion Checklist
- [ ] New source files: [list them]
- [ ] Test files created: [list them, or "N/A — no new source files"]
- [ ] CQ self-eval: [score/20, or "N/A — tests only"]
- [ ] Test self-eval: [score/17, or "N/A — no tests written"]
- [ ] Critical gates passed: [YES/NO + which failed]
- [ ] All tests pass: [YES/NO]
```

**If any line is missing or "TODO" — task is NOT complete. Go back and fix.**

Rules:
- New source file without test file = BLOCKED (pre-commit hook enforces this)
- CQ score < 14 or critical gate fail = FIX before finishing
- Test score < 14 or critical gate fail (Q7/Q11/Q13/Q15/Q17) = FIX before finishing
- Feature touching 3+ files without `/build` = WRONG WORKFLOW, restart
